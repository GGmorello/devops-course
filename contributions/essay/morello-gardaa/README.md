## Description

Essay describing DevOps applied at developing of quantum computing applications, we describe why devops is important in quantum computing, we describe quantum software lifecycle, how to implement devops in Azure, we also give a brief introduction to qauntum computing.


**Relevance**

Quantum software engineering is still at a very early stage, and thegap with research in quantum information is growing larger, in addition to that every quantum provider is moving in different directions making it hard to have a clear unified
software lifecycle. Quantum services and applications are also more complex to develop, deploy and mantain so we think DevOps has to play an importan role in the making of reliable qauntum software.
